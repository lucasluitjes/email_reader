Finishing up the AMA from the prompt 3 weeks ago.

Whew=2C that was exhausting=2C but I finally worked through the backlog of=
 AMAs. I have a few straggler questions to respond to=2C but those seemed=
 either repetitive in relation to the ones I'm sharing here=2C or not of b=
road interest. I'll respond in person to the remaining ones in a day or tw=
o.

Anyhow=2C thanks everybody for playing. This was partly a load-testing exp=
eriment to figure out the volume of Q&A I could handle=2C and I'm definite=
ly not going to be doing this too often. Tackling 70+ questions in 2 sitti=
ngs is quite the workout.

In other news=2C we just hit 100 sign-ups for the Breaking Smart Season 1=
 Workshop (https://ribbonfarm.teachable.com/p/breaking-smart-season-1/) in=
 the first week. Thank you all. I just uploaded the second session lecture=
 videos.

For those of you still intending to sign up=2C last week's code EARLYBIRD=
 will work till midnight (US Pacific) tonight and get you 50% off. If you=
 miss the deadline=2C well=2C you'll have to use the code NOTSOEARLYBIRD a=
nd settle for 25% off. This will work till midnight next Friday (Feb 8). T=
hen it will ratchet down further.

Now for the AMAs. And one TMS (Tell Me Something).

In a non hierarchical=2C matrix oriented world=2C how should groups (teams=
=2C companies=2C countries) make a conscious decision to stop "kicking the=
 can down the road" and proactively start to tackle a particular problem.=
  What are the signs and indicators that should tell a team to take action=
? -- Tom Broderick

I have never seen "groups" effectively solve a problem like this. It's a d=
isguised form of a tragedy of the commons. The only way out is for an indi=
vidual with enough political capital to make some "benevolent dictator" mo=
ves to break the gridlock. No amount of fiddling with structural aspects w=
ill solve the problem. When terms like "matrix management" and "cross-func=
tional" become embedded in a stalemate conversation=2C it is no longer som=
ething that can be solved at a group level. An individual has to make some=
 unilateral hard calls and then burn political capital to get others to fo=
llow their lead. Only individuals can precipitate the kinds of crisis that=
 can break the stalemates that teams and groups can get themselves into. A=
nd vice-versa (though you didn't ask about that).

If someone gives you a decent amount of capital ($1Billion+) where only st=
ring would be to build resilience of the human condition / Global Social C=
omputer in the Cloud against being bricked by a mass flippage of bozobits.=
 What kind of team would you assemble and what would you build? -- Varun A=
dibhatla

I think this sort of thing is what people like the Kochs=2C Mercers=2C Sor=
os think they are doing. I think it's dangerous to define and pursue chall=
enges at this scale with bounding boxes defined by financial capital and "=
assembling people" into world-changing missionary tribes. Money is for the=
 complex but more narrowly bounded problems of the sort that the Gates fou=
ndation for example tries to solve. If you're aiming for something as broa=
d and ambitious as "build resilience of the human condition"=2C money is t=
he wrong starting point. Historically it has played a role in increasing r=
esilience (basic research funding for say healthcare or food security). Bu=
t for what you're talking about=2C I think "people assembled with money" i=
s a part of the problem rather than the solution.

What=E2=80=99s the optimistic case for how software can eat climate impact=
 and help win the war to decarbonize in time? -- Patrick Atwater

I think that ship has sailed. We are not going to "decarbonize in time." W=
e're going to gradually normalize climate change=2C one bit of weirdness a=
t a time. I think software will play a huge role in eventually decarbonizi=
ng and helping complete the energy transition (both directly=2C by enablin=
g clean energy etc=2C and indirectly by substituting low-energy behaviors=
 like video-conferencing for energy-intensive ones like travel) but it won=
't be "in time."  I think it is time to pivot to asking how software can h=
elp as many people as possible weather the unavoidable impacts. Mass migra=
tion is a big one. An example of the kind of idea I'd like to see pursued=
 is this "Internet of Migrants" idea I did a twitter thread (https://twitt=
er.com/vgr/status/1058051052975546368)  about.

Have you read any Tom McCarthy (https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar=
/07/tom-mccarthy-death-writing-james-joyce-working-google) ? Repetition=2C=
 buffering=2C and being human in a software eaten world. -- Passepartout

No=2C thanks for the recommendation!

You've written in the past about the rise of cities. As larger state gover=
nments lose leverage=2C cities will break off and innovate. I'm the bigges=
t business podcaster in Pittsburgh (https://www.goingdeepwithaaron.com/pit=
tsburgh.html) =2C PA. Am I unwise to try and "break out" of that box? Or s=
hould I double down on my geographic edge? -- Aaron Watson

Nice=2C congrats on your podcast success. I think the "city state future"=
 hasn't been properly harmonized with the "digital future." It's like ther=
e are these 2 huge trends towards devolving geographic power to cities=2C=
 and diffusing digital power via strong zeitgeist currents and vortices on=
 massive global platforms. These are like the quantum mechanics and genera=
l relativity of sociology in our times. And just as physicists haven't fig=
ured out how to really put the two together in a grand unified theory=2C n=
one of us has managed to put together the city-state future and the digita=
l future in a compelling unified vision. I mean=2C the novels of Neal Step=
henson are fun to read and all=2C but when you get right down to it=2C nob=
ody knows how these two trends will interact.

I think the best strategy for somebody with a foot in both worlds=2C as a=
 city-focused podcaster like you would be=2C is to pay attention to both w=
orlds independently and not try to force a false synthesis. Where somethin=
g makes sense both as a bet on Pittsburgh and a bet on digital futures=2C=
 it's easy. When the two are in conflict=2C I don't think you can expect t=
o find general grand-unified theory answers. Maybe Pittsburgh becomes the=
 2nd biggest city in the world for some weird new global online business s=
ector like fidget spinners. Should you bet on that development in a Pittsb=
urgh-first way or a fidget-spinners first way (which might mean focusing o=
n city #1)? There won't be one right answer. You'll have to take it case b=
y case.

Any good tips on how to make relationships with interesting people? I'm li=
ving in a new city and in need of mentors and friends with interesting phi=
losophies of work and life to learn from. Not just smart people with simil=
ar interests--interesting people. -- Drew Schorno

I am the worst person to ask this question when it comes to meatspace=2C s=
ince I've managed to live in half a dozen cities with an unbroken record o=
f being spectacularly bad at this. If you're talking online=2C however=2C=
 I'm a blackbelt at that. My answer for the online version is to simply pr=
oduce and publish interesting things yourself. Interesting attracts intere=
sting. Maybe you can focus it to be more relevant to the city you're in=2C=
 but I have no idea how to do that. My own style of producing stuff doesn'=
t seem to stay within any such nice boundaries.

Your Brain-Bicycle-(Rider-Fit) article resonates with me! I'm stuck in an=
 uphill ride wobbling along (the bicycle that I've chosen may not be suita=
ble for me) how do I get competent in negotiating and structuring deals? -=
- Weiyi Yang

I'm blanking on where I wrote about that metaphor=2C but am happy to take=
 credit for it :) I assume you're doing the obvious things relating to you=
r challenge=2C like finding books and classes on negotiations and deal-mak=
ing. So let's go beyond that a bit.

When it comes to loose touch-and-feel type skills like negotiating and str=
ucturing deals where you're trying to add some hard structure to squishy s=
tuff=2C I've found that the only way to really learn is to watch a more se=
asoned expert do it live=2C and pick up on their tricks. It's a form of cl=
ose observation. What conversational tactics do they use? How do they brea=
k out of predictable objections? Do they use specific phrases? And of cour=
se you have to get good at studying the "hard" side -- parsing deals and c=
ontracts=2C learning to read legalese well enough to not let lawyers bulls=
hit you=2C etc. There's plenty of literature and training available on thi=
s subject. Paradoxically=2C the more complex it gets -- huge billion dolla=
r M&As for example -- the easier it is in some ways=2C because the sheer s=
ize and risk of the activity forces a lot of professionalism=2C well-defin=
ed role boundaries=2C formal protocols=2C and emergence of best practices.=
 It can be harder to negotiate and structure a
deal about play time with a 5-year-old.

How do you know when your "bicycle" doesn't fit? When you sense that your=
 natural "literacy" in reading what more experienced people are doing is l=
acking=2C like there's whole levels of the conversation you're missing or=
 misreading=2C and can't predict outcomes. It seems like black magic. Norm=
ally=2C any non-technical skilled practice should slowly become legible to=
 an intelligent observer with the right aptitude=2C with time. But if it d=
oesn't=2C you may not have aptitude for it.

Are you consulting for any projects that involve crypto/blockchain/Bitcoin=
? Do you have insight into which parts of the cryptosphere are cargo cults=
?  -- Stefan King

I've done a small amount of consulting on crypto projects where there are=
 aspects that don't have much to do specifically with crypto itself=2C but=
 am by no means particularly well-versed in how the sector is shaping up.=
 I have no particularly good instincts for picking the winners and sniffin=
g out the cargo cults. I'm not particularly bad at it either. In general=
=2C I don't trust myself to do the required thinking here myself. Instead=
=2C I rely on good friends who know a lot more than me at both the technic=
al and business levels.

Have you ever played a JRPG? If so=2C which one=2C and what did you think=
 of it? -- Ellen Kaye-Cheveldayoff

No=2C I'm afraid I don't even know what a JRPG is. I had to look it up (ht=
tps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_Japanese_role-playing_gam=
e_franchises) :)

What was the most significant piece of advice you received early on in you=
r career? Did it have a "eureka" like effect or were its benefits realized=
 over time? For context=2C I am a recent college graduate working full tim=
e at a nonprofit where I interned in college=2C but am dissatisfied and tr=
ying to plot out my next move. -- Anonymous

I'm bad at asking for=2C and taking=2C advice in general. I'm much better=
 at dishing it out confidently :) I did recently write a post about my PhD=
 advisor who recently passed away=2C and the things I learned from him (ht=
tps://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/01/10/remembering-pierre-kabamba/) . No eure=
ka effects=2C however. I don't trust advice that causes that kind of sudde=
n red-pill effect. I prefer deceptively simple-sounding advice that takes=
 years to sink in.

How do you think you would've handled the modern dating app culture=2C had=
 you been dating today? -- Nicolas Lawler

Probably horrifyingly badly. I have no idea how young singles manage to na=
vigate that world.

What=E2=80=99s your personal recommendation on blogs & books for self deve=
lopment on financial literacy? -- Seun Awoyele

I don't think I've consciously worked on "self-development" in like 15 yea=
rs. David Allen's Getting Things Done was the last significant bit of self=
-development literature I internalized=2C and that was 2002-04. I don't tr=
ust the idea of "developing" yourself=2C especially past 30. Before 30=2C=
 it kinda doesn't matter what self-development ideas you consume. Pick wha=
t resonates with you=2C internalize what feels right=2C trust your gut. It=
's not as important as it seems at the time.

I trust the idea of least-effort paths and enlightened mediocrity much mor=
e. I think it's a mistake to "optimize" the self. The older I get=2C the m=
ore wisdom I see in letting life happen to you=2C with your self evolving=
 in a more natural way=2C as a result of actually dealing with the specifi=
c challenges you face. Your life does not have to be a development project=
=2E It's not a developing country or an iPhone with versions. Instead of try=
ing to "develop" my "self"=2C I try to navigate situations in hopefully im=
aginative ways. Solve your problems=2C not your "life."

All my financial literacy is second-hand and not worth either bragging abo=
ut or turning into advice for others. Ultimately=2C finance does not inter=
est me. I try not to be too dumb about it=2C but it's not a game I feel li=
ke getting more literate at.

Hume's problem of induction=2C Godel's incompleteness theorems=2C the free=
-will/determinism paradoxes=2C the lack of explanations for emergence - Do=
 they all point to the same thing? (that consciousness is expressed throug=
h brains but not created by them and that our current language systems don=
't know how to fully study it). -- Zat Rana

Kinda cute how you snuck in a presumptive consensus explanandum there=2C b=
egging your own question to some extent :) I don't know if they all point=
 to the same thing=2C but language systems certainly seem like an inadequa=
te tool for studying any of these imponderables or their "pointing" propen=
sities. I don't know that "study" is even the right verb to apply=2C since=
 these things you're gesturing at precede epistemology. Similarly "pointin=
g" assumes a relationship of reference between two distinct things=2C whic=
h is assuming a lot at this level of philosophy. To study or point is to "=
do" something. Some would argue that our relationship to these things is a=
 matter of being rather than doing. There are mystics around who are confi=
dent that their private experiences qualify as truer ways of being with th=
ese things than "studying" them per se.

To cut to the chase=2C I used to have beliefs and positions about these th=
ings. Now=2C mostly I don't=2C since I find that holding positions doesn't=
 actually change anything for me in relation to these imponderables.

How do I become a member of the cryptobourgeoisie? -- Steven Miller

Buy some crypto=2C HODL and pray. You've got as good a chance as anyone el=
se. The only way to make it more than a passive casino bet for yourself is=
 to learn the technology and get involved in building the stuff.

How do you decide how much money you need? Also=2C how do you know how muc=
h you must get paid? -- Tejesh

I've managed to get through nearly 45 years of life without ever asking ei=
ther of these questions=2C so my answer is=2C you don't need to decide or=
 know. I've never liked asking finance questions in the abstract. If there=
 are concrete numbers I need to think about=2C they generally fall out of=
 other considerations like rent or retirement savings or stuff I want and=
 have to pay for=2C like sandwiches or a car. I like the saying "money is=
 a problem to be solved." I take it to mean that in the process of decidin=
g what to do in other parts of life=2C inevitably money comes up as a vari=
able in the mix=2C and you need it to do certain things. "Solve" the money=
 problem one instance at a time. Unless you're in finance or want to get r=
ich for the sake of getting rich=2C money is not something that's producti=
ve to think about front-and-center for most people. If you want to take on=
 money more directly=2C you should be in finance.

If the purpose driving the last era was growth=2C would you agree that the=
 most beneficial purpose for our next (and current) era is health or balan=
ce=2C or do you believe it is something else? And what do you believe is r=
equired to shift society to this new purpose? -- Katie Levine

I don't believe in such collective "purpose" conversations because that's=
 never been how the world has worked. And I certainly don't believe in try=
ing to "shift" society. Thar be toxic ideological tarpits. The "purpose" o=
f an era is something that's evident with hindsight with tasteful historic=
al perspective. And it's always something of a fiction imposed on the emer=
gent motivational patterns of billions of people acting at various levels=
 of coordination. Right now=2C in 2019=2C each of us will do what we think=
 best at whatever scale of coordinated agency we act at=2C and we'll know=
 what it all means when we are unfrozen from our cryostasis chambers in 22=
34 and the history orientation guide tells us what the 21st century was al=
l about.

How many 2x2 matrices do you make before you stumble across one that is in=
sightful? Or - do you have insight=2C then see if you convert it to a 2x2?=
 -- Todd Nief

It's the latter 99% of the time. And generally=2C it's not an explicit att=
empt to convert an insight into a 2x2=2C but the insight itself striking m=
y awareness in a half-done 2x2 form that I then have to tweak to get it ri=
ght. I suspect this is how it is for most people. Making random 2x2s in se=
arch of an insightful one doesn't seem like a workable process to me.

I am attempting to catch up on breakingsmart and ribbonfarm=2C do you have=
 a "best of"=2C most popular=2C or preferred reading order? -- Peter Willi=
ams

There's a New Reader page (https://www.ribbonfarm.com/for-new-readers/) fo=
r ribbonfarm=2C but for Breaking Smart=2C besides the Season 1 essays=2C t=
here's no curation of the newsletter contents. I should probably get on th=
at.

Been thinking about Cal Newport=E2=80=99s idea of =E2=80=98career success=
 comes from having rare and valuable skills=E2=80=99 recently. (a) What ar=
e your thoughts on this idea? (b) What skills will be rare and valuable in=
 the future? -- Daniel Thomasan

It's certainly one way to have career success. It's not the only way. Ther=
e's Scott Adams' idea of having two relatively not-rare skills that are ra=
re in combination for example (in his case=2C drawing skill and a sense of=
 humor). And then there are non-skill-based approaches to thinking about c=
areer success. And then there's thinking about life in terms other than "c=
areer success." In general=2C I'm not exactly the greatest fan of Cal Newp=
ort's advice=2C tbf. It sort of works for people on strongly credentialist=
 life paths=2C but is of limited value outside such paths. I wrote a newsl=
etter issue riffing off of (my skepticism of) his thinking a while back: S=
emicolon-Shaped People.  (https://mailchi.mp/ribbonfarm/semicolon-shaped-p=
eople?e=3D6dbfe3b926)

I've been thinking about this bit from "The Key to Act Two (https://www.ri=
bbonfarm.com/2018/03/29/the-key-to-act-two/) ":

"Then there is a bit of an intermission of about 2 years=2C which for most=
 people is a very confusing=2C unscripted time=2C like an inter-airport tr=
ansfer in a strange foreign city with sketchy-looking shuttle buses that y=
ou are reluctant to get on=2C and long queues at the bathroom."

Question: What specific advice would you have for someone in this intermis=
sion who is pretty thoroughly traumatized but not sure if she's learned en=
ough from it=2C more made the right connections=2C to become a key? -- Ano=
nymous

I think the best thing to do if you really are in this stage (and it's eas=
y to mistake a bout of depression for an Act I to Act 2 transitional inter=
mission)=2C is to lower your standards=2C embrace enlightened mediocrity=
=2C and focus on living well rather than "learning." Don't close your mind=
 to learning=2C and accept the challenges and new experiences that life wi=
ll continue to throw at you=2C but "learning" and "preparing" for life is=
 no longer task #1. Task #1 is actually just surviving with grace and livi=
ng life. Stop trying to win=2C work on continuing the game. Sometimes that=
's one day at a time=2C sometimes it's one year at a time. The life-long l=
earning=2C hustling=2C stress-driving pressure we get from society is some=
what necessary (at a cost) in Act 1=2C but if you let it keep riding you i=
nto Act 2=2C it's mostly masochism. There's a point past which it makes mo=
re sense (and better mental health) to inhabit the life you've built for y=
ourself as gracefully as you can=2C rather than trying
to keep raging and storming to extract more from the universe.

One thought I've found useful for this lately is: you don't need permissio=
n to exist.

Why don't people think big enough? Where do your large scale thoughts expr=
essed in your writing come from? As an ambitious thinker=2C how can I bett=
er express my big ideas and get started building them when I find it diffi=
cult to see the small=2C more actionable beginner stuff? -- Elijah Claude

Hmm. I don't agree that people don't think big enough or that it's a parti=
cularly good thing to try and do. You should think about interesting thing=
s=2C with enough imagination and courage to let a thought take you as far=
 as it wants to take you. Some thoughts want to take on huge galloping rid=
es across the universe=2C other thoughts want to take you 3 steps to pay a=
ttention to one small thing. I think it is important to not get attached t=
o the scale of thoughts or actions. One trick to do this is to imagine tho=
ughts and actions as having all the agency=2C and you having none. The tho=
ught decides how it wants to be thought. The action decides how it wants t=
o be performed. Your job is to get out of the way and let the thought or a=
ction "use" you as its instrument. Be the medium=2C not the message or the=
 agent.

Ambition is not bad per se=2C but it can exhaust itself. It is like runnin=
g on fossil fuels of the psyche. It can also work into a box it cannot wor=
k itself out of. In a way=2C ambition itself is one of the thoughts/action=
 patterns that can possess you=2C and in my experience=2C not one that tak=
es you on particularly interesting rides. Things we often describe as "amb=
itious" from an outside perspective are often the result of being possesse=
d by thoughts and actions that feel necessary and natural rather than "amb=
itious" to the people who serve as their mediums. The thoughts and actions=
 I find myself most fascinated by (both my own and those of others) are th=
ose that are the result of the human ego stepping out of the way and letti=
ng the thoughts and actions flow on their own. I suppose I'm a Taoist or s=
omething.

Do you use randomness for any of your processes (e.g. dice=2C decks of car=
ds=2C or anything else)? What about contrarian thinking? Oh also=2C I beli=
eve you visited Boyd=E2=80=99s papers at Quantico. What did you think? Whi=
ch papers and books did you read? -- Chris Butler

No. Life is plenty random enough for me=2C and contrarian thinking for its=
 own sake seems kinda dumb to me. Think interesting thoughts=2C and someti=
mes they are contrarian=2C other times they are not.

I didn't spend much time at the archives. We were there for like half an h=
our as I recall. I browsed several papers on Network-Centric Warfare (NCW)=
 with Boyd's critical annotations in the margins. As I mentioned in an old=
 newsletter (https://us1.campaign-archive.com/?u=3D78cbbb7f2882629a5157fa5=
93&id=3D6018c6315f) =2C one thing I took away was the idea that he didn't=
 like tight synchronization.

How would you innovate public restrooms? Improving cleanliness metric -- A=
nonymous

It's actually among the most important problems in the world. I have Rose=
 George's book The Big Necessity (https://amzn.to/2WzB5pA) =2C on my to-re=
ad pile. No clever thoughts besides the assessment that it's a very import=
ant problem.

                            Whew=2C that was exhausting=2C but I finally w=
orked through the backlog of AMAs. I have a few straggler questions to res=

 sharing here=2C or not of broad interest. I'll respond in person to the r=
emaining ones in a day or two.<br>
<br>
Anyhow=2C thanks everybody for playing. This was partly a load-testing exp=
eriment to figure out the volume of Q&amp;A I could handle=2C and I'm defi=
nitely not going to be doing this too often. Tackling 70+ questions in 2 s=

For those of you still intending to sign up=2C last week's code <strong>EA=

 50% off. If you miss the deadline=2C well=2C you'll have to use the code=

<br>
I have never seen "groups" effectively solve a problem like this. It's a d=
isguised form of a tragedy of the commons. The only way out is for an indi=
vidual with enough political capital to make some "benevolent dictator" mo=
ves to break the gridlock. No amount of fiddling with structural aspects w=
ill solve the problem. When terms like "matrix management" and "cross-func=
tional" become embedded in a stalemate conversation=2C it is no longer som=
ething that can be solved at a group level. An individual has to make some=
 unilateral hard calls and then burn political capital to get others to fo=
llow their lead. Only individuals can precipitate the kinds of crisis that=
 can break the stalemates that teams and groups can get themselves into. A=
nd vice-versa (though you didn't ask about that).<br>

I think this sort of thing is what people like the Kochs=2C Mercers=2C Sor=

assembling people" into world-changing missionary tribes. Money is for the=
 complex but more narrowly bounded problems of the sort that the Gates fou=

he wrong starting point. Historically it has played a role in increasing r=

 -- Aaron Watson</em><br>
<br>
Nice=2C congrats on your podcast success. I think the "city state future"=
 hasn't been properly harmonized with the "digital future." It's like ther=
e are these 2 huge trends towards devolving geographic power to cities=2C=
 and diffusing digital power via strong zeitgeist currents and vortices on=
 massive global platforms. These are like the quantum mechanics and genera=
l relativity of sociology in our times. And just as physicists haven't fig=
ured out how to really put the two together in a grand unified theory=2C n=
one of us has managed to put together the city-state future and the digita=
l future in a compelling unified vision. I mean=2C the novels of Neal Step=
henson are fun to read and all=2C but when you get right down to it=2C nob=
ody knows how these two trends will interact.<br>
<br>
I think the best strategy for somebody with a foot in both worlds=2C as a=
 city-focused podcaster like you would be=2C is to pay attention to both w=
orlds independently and not try to force a false synthesis. Where somethin=
g makes sense both as a bet on Pittsburgh and a bet on digital futures=2C=
 it's easy. When the two are in conflict=2C I don't think you can expect t=
o find general grand-unified theory answers. Maybe Pittsburgh becomes the=
 2nd biggest city in the world for some weird new global online business s=
ector like fidget spinners. Should you bet on that development in a Pittsb=
urgh-first way or a fidget-spinners first way (which might mean focusing o=
n city #1)? There won't be one right answer. You'll have to take it case b=
y case.&nbsp;<br>

se you have to get good at studying the "hard" side -- parsing deals and c=
ontracts=2C learning to read legalese well enough to not let lawyers bulls=

ng life. Stop trying to win=2C&nbsp;work on continuing the game. Sometimes=
 that's one day at a time=2C sometimes it's one year at a time.&nbsp;The&n=
bsp;life-long learning=2C hustling=2C stress-driving pressure we get from=
 society is somewhat necessary (at a cost) in Act 1=2C but if you let it k=
eep riding you into Act 2=2C it's mostly masochism. There's a point past w=
hich it makes more sense (and better mental health) to inhabit the life yo=
u've built for yourself as gracefully as you can=2C rather than trying to=
 keep raging and storming to extract more from the universe.<br>
<br>
One thought I've found useful for this lately is: you don't need permissio=
n to exist.<br>
<br>
<em>Why don't people think big enough? Where do your large scale thoughts=
 expressed in your writing come from? As an ambitious thinker=2C how can I=
 better express my big ideas and get started building them when I find it=
 difficult to see the small=2C more actionable beginner stuff? -- Elijah C=
laude</em><br>
<br>
Hmm. I don't agree that people don't think big enough or that it's a parti=
cularly good thing to try and do. You should think about interesting thing=
s=2C with enough imagination and courage to let a thought take you as far=
 as it wants to take you. Some thoughts want to take on huge galloping rid=
es across the universe=2C other thoughts want to take you 3 steps to pay a=
ttention to one small thing. I think it is important to not get attached t=
o the scale of thoughts or actions. One trick to do this is to imagine tho=
ughts and actions as having all the agency=2C and you having none. The tho=
ught decides how it wants to be thought. The action decides how it wants t=
o be performed. Your job is to get out of the way and let the thought or a=
ction "use" you as its instrument. Be the medium=2C not the message or the=
 agent.<br>
<br>
Ambition is not bad per se=2C but it can exhaust itself. It is like runnin=
g on fossil fuels of the psyche. It can also work into a box it cannot wor=
k itself out of. In a way=2C ambition itself is one of the thoughts/action=
 patterns that can possess you=2C and in my experience=2C not one that tak=
es you on particularly interesting rides. Things we often describe as "amb=
itious" from an outside perspective are often the result of being possesse=
d by thoughts and actions that feel necessary and natural rather than "amb=
itious" to the people who serve as their mediums. The thoughts and actions=
 I find myself most fascinated by (both my own and those of others) are th=
ose that are the result of&nbsp;the human ego stepping out of the way and=
 letting the thoughts and actions flow on their own. I suppose I'm a Taois=
t or something.&nbsp;</p>

No. Life is plenty random enough for me=2C and contrarian thinking for its=
