First set of responses to the AMA prompt from last week

Well=2C I got 70-odd questions in response to my AMA prompt last week. Onl=
y a couple of TMS -- tell me something --  responses though. So that part=
 of the experiment didn't quite work.

Almost all the questions were kinda interesting and fun to think about=2C=
 so I'm going to post my responses to almost of them. It's too much for on=
e newsletter=2C so I'm going to break it down into two issues. Here's the=
 first set of responses=2C to the first 33 questions=2C taken in order. I'=
ll do the rest next week. In some cases=2C I've anonymized the question ev=
en though the questioner didn't ask for it=2C since the details seemed per=
sonal.

The questions span the gamut from industry trends and personal career ques=
tions to Big History questions and questions about consciousness. What I l=
earned about myself is that I am sort of the Walmart of quick premium-medi=
ocre baseline takes on almost any subject. I don't have to think for more=
 than a few seconds to come up with an off-the-top-of-my-head not-too-terr=
ible answer to most questions. Only one person managed to entirely stump m=
e in this set.

Well hear we go. Good Afternoon=2C Internet=2C I'm Talking.

1. Seems like politics is the last bastion of society to be disrupted (wit=
h the possible exception of the military - although Iraq and Afghanistan c=
ertainly tried).  Anyway=2C with the social media prowess of AOC on the he=
els of trump=2C is the political establishment in for a disruptive awakeni=
ng? -- Ben Kohlmann

I don=E2=80=99t think I=E2=80=99d call it an awakening. More a sleepening.=
 A dark age is essentially when public life retreats and is replaced by a=
 mix of expanded domestic life and feudal life.

2. What's your single favorite essay you've ever written=2C as of right no=
w? - Drew Austin

Probably On the Design of Escaped Realities (https://www.ribbonfarm.com/20=
15/01/16/on-the-design-of-escaped-realities/) . It is neither a very good=
 piece of writing=2C nor was it a big performer. However=2C it is the main=
 public trailhead for almost all the thinking I=E2=80=99ve been doing in p=
rivate since then.

3. At 39 years of age=2C having mastered nothing (yet)=2C what is the most=
 valuable thing I can learn? -- Francisco G.

You=E2=80=99ve survived and made it to 39. There is deeper mastery than yo=
u might realize merely in doing that (unless of course=2C you=E2=80=99ve b=
een living off a trust-fund from rich parents or something). I=E2=80=99m t=
old James Joyce=E2=80=99s Ulysees is in fact an appreciation of the enormo=
us accomplishment that is ordinary humans simply getting through everyday=
 life. I think in fact it takes more courage to be ordinary than extraordi=
nary. It=E2=80=99s worth reflecting on your life on occasion and trying to=
 unpack how exactly you=E2=80=99ve managed to survive as long as you have.

4. Does tweeting give or take energy from you? (extro/intro-vert?) -- Edwa=
rd G.

I don=E2=80=99t think extrovert/introvert is the right spectrum. It energi=
zes me when I=E2=80=99m depressed and in =E2=80=9Cretreat=E2=80=9D mode=2C=
 and annoys me when I=E2=80=99m feeling hypomanic and in attack mode. I th=
ink I defend/protect my psyche on twitter=2C but attack by blogging. So th=
e correct spectrum may be creative production versus refractory/relaxation=
 cycling.

5. If you were to base an essay on another tv series like you did with The=
 Gervais Principle and The Office=2C what would it be and why? -- Isaac Mo=
rehouse

Probably Rick and Morty. The =E2=80=9CTo be fair you have to have a fairly=
 high IQ to understand Rick and Morty=E2=80=9D copypasta (https://knowyour=
meme.com/memes/to-be-fair-you-have-to-have-a-very-high-iq-to-understand-ri=
ck-and-morty) actually is right about the real depth in the show=2C though=
 it does not lie where the copypasta author thinks it does=2C in the nerdy=
=2C esoteric obscurity of cultural/philosophical references. In fact=2C I=
=E2=80=99d probably try to do a series covering the entire history of adul=
t animated series=2C focusing on the evolution from The Simpsons to South=
 Park=2C and then Rick and Morty.

6. Favorite Crispy Junk Food? -- Aryeh Nielsen

Pakoras

7. Apparently the Marie Kondo Spark Joy based show has made a lot of waves=
=2E It personally affected me quite a bit actually as a new parent trying to=
 function in the real world after 2 decades online. Your boring resolution=
 has resonated in a similar way=2C do you see a connection? -- Ian Johnson

I think people are genuinely hurting from the toxicity of the public spher=
e=2C and this is part of the broader retreat to self-care behaviors. I thi=
nk it=E2=80=99s a generation-defining phase and a particularly historic do=
wncycle in public life. It may intersect more or less with life stages. It=
 aligns with your new challenges as a parent (and mine as a slowing middle=
-aged type). But I don=E2=80=99t think it aligns that well with everybody=
=E2=80=99s life in all life stages/situations. I would guess=2C for exampl=
e=2C that it is terrible for young singles who are in the dating market. T=
his is not exactly a great time to be out looking for a partner.

8. What's the most mindquake-inducing book you've read in recent memory? =
 Why? -- Shane Hoverston

Mooncop (https://www.amazon.com/Mooncop-Tom-Gauld/dp/1770462546) by Tom Ga=
uld. Not so much a mindquake as an anti-mindquake. We have too many mindqu=
akes going on right now=2C so that=E2=80=99s not something I value too muc=
h. But anti-mindquakes are rare and valuable. It is a very elemental and s=
imple graphic novel about a lunar base being abandoned. I reread it a doze=
n times in the few weeks I had it checked out from the library. It=E2=80=
=99s like a memento mori for society rather than individuals.

9. If you had to select a spouse but could only know answers to three ques=
tions=2C what would the questions be? -- Anonymous

Q1: Saver or spender?

Q2: Neat or messy?

Q3: High-energy or low-energy personality?

These are not necessarily =E2=80=9Cchoice=E2=80=9D questions (as in=2C the=
re are no right answers) but the =E2=80=9Ceigenvectors=E2=80=9D of relatio=
nship adaptation. I think there=E2=80=99s a theory of 2^3 =3D 8 marriage t=
ypes there. All 8 types can succeed or fail=2C but if you want to know wha=
t you=E2=80=99d be getting into=2C those are the 3 most significant bits.

10. What advice would you give to an independent consultant looking to do=
 more "weird" or non-traditional work - for example the philosopher-in-res=
idence work you did for A16Z and the original Breaking Smart? Thanks! -- T=
om Critchlow

I think you just have to do whatever most energizes you and produces a lot=
 of output=2C and let the work/opportunities find you. I have never gotten=
 an enjoyable weird gig out of going fishing myself. You choose boring=2C=
 normal work=2C but interesting=2C weird work chooses you.

Quantity has a quality all its own as Lenin said. The sheer volume of your=
 work is what works as a signal of weirdness=2C because anyone can be do a=
 one-off weird thing=2C but only volume can signal a consistently weird pr=
oduction sensibility that will inspire people betting on you. The energy e=
vident in a body of work is the most honest signal about it that makes peo=
ple trust you to do things for them.

11. What =E2=80=9Ccommon sense=E2=80=9D norms do you feel the crypto space=
 would *gain* from using? Similarly=2C what =E2=80=9Cweird crypto norm=E2=
=80=9D do you think should be more prevalent in the rest of the internet/w=
orld? -- Tim Beiko

The crypto space should try to adopt =E2=80=9Cpaving the cowpaths=E2=80=9D=
 as a norm.

Rest of the Internet world would benefit from =E2=80=9Ctrusted third parti=
es are a security hole=E2=80=9D thinking.

12. Good coworkers (decent human beings)=2C decent money=2C good potential=
 upside (stick around another couple years)=2C but unmotivating work. What=
 should one do? -- Anonymous

This is a hard problem. I see motivation as synonymous with high-volume ou=
tput. Whatever your mode of =E2=80=9Cwork=2C=E2=80=9D you are motivated if=
 and only if you=E2=80=99re producing high-volume output driven by a tight=
 positive feedback loop keeping you in flow state=2C which is by nature un=
stable. Two ways it breaks is if the feedback loop doesn=E2=80=99t fuel yo=
ur imagination (insufficient novelty in the OODA loop) or it doesn=E2=80=
=99t fuel your risk appetite (insufficient stakes in the OODA loop).

If it is risk=2C you can financially engineer a risk differential between=
 you and your coworkers (example=2C take on personal debt for a bigger equ=
ity position and use that to go after riskier business where you=E2=80=99l=
l suffer the downside and upside more). If it is imagination=2C it is much=
 harder: you have to siphon off a portion of working cash flow to fund mor=
e interesting activities=2C but you will need to find collaborators with t=
he an impedance matched imagination.

Alternately=2C perhaps you can just think of separating =E2=80=9Csex=E2=80=
=9D and =E2=80=9Ccash=E2=80=9D sides of life like Hugh MacLeod recommends=
 (https://www.gapingvoid.com/blog/2004/03/25/the-sex-cash-theory/) . I=E2=
=80=99ve found that hard to do=2C but it seems to work for some people.

13. What's your opinion about the value of creating 1-=2C 2-=2C 5-=2C 10-y=
ear plans? If you see value=2C what are your key recommendations for devel=
opment?" -- Barak Epstein

I=E2=80=99ve gone back and forth on these. Sometimes they are practically=
 necessary because of the context. You don=E2=80=99t get to Mars without a=
 long-term plan of sorts. If there are no practical constraints dictating=
 long-range planning=2C there is still value to the process of planning ev=
en if it doesn=E2=80=99t get used (this is Eisenhower=E2=80=99s famous =E2=
=80=9Cplans are nothing=2C planning is everything=E2=80=9D). But then agai=
n=2C some things don=E2=80=99t need even that and are actively hurt by it.=
 I don=E2=80=99t think bloggers should plan more than a few posts out at m=
ost. It=E2=80=99s a recipe for failure. If you want to go longer range=2C=
 write a book (ie pick a project structure that has the time constants you=
 are attracted to).

Beyond these? I think it comes down to temperament really. Everybody has a=
 natural time constant=2C and constraints tying them to domains with domai=
n time contexts. If the two are not aligned=2C the outcome is misery. If t=
hey are=2C there=E2=80=99s a chance you=E2=80=99ll be productive and do in=
teresting things.

14. Do you have any recommendations for a very perceptive 14yo who is low-=
key freaking about the what looks like collapse of nearly everything? -- =
 Anonymous

I was 14 in 1988=2C when a similar collapse was looming=2C and I too was l=
ow-key freaking out=2C and hey whaddya know=2C that was the right response=
=2E Things did in fact end up collapsing in important ways=2C and those of u=
s who came of age around then did in fact have to reorient in a new world.=
 So I think it=E2=80=99s important to let this healthy instinct to =E2=80=
=9Clow key freak out=E2=80=9D exercise itself. It means the kid has high s=
ituation awareness and is responding with a lively imagination. I=E2=80=99=
m not a parent=2C but I=E2=80=99d say your job as a parent is to provide t=
he support of a firm family ground under their feet. Governing their imagi=
nation is their job=2C and though you may be able to short-term help them=
 by interfering at that level=2C in the long term it is best if they figur=
e out their own approach to managing their imaginations.

15. How much longer until deindustrialized America realizes it=E2=80=99s c=
ompetitiveness is never coming back and what=E2=80=99s your exit plan? Why=
 does the talk center around retreating to off grid mansions=2C why not br=
ing new lands under cultivation and start new walled cities. (e.g. =E2=80=
=98starforts=E2=80=99) -- Arjunan Gnanendran

Two years ago=2C I=E2=80=99d have said I don=E2=80=99t agree with your pre=
mises. Now=2C I=E2=80=99m not so sure. The fundamentals are still there=2C=
 and with sufficient immigration=2C the aging population part of the probl=
em (the only significant problem) can be addressed and post-industrial eco=
nomic vitality can be put on a firm foundation. There are of course parts=
 of the problem that cannot be escaped (like climate change impact).

But none of this matters if people stop believing in the story altogether.

As for me personally=2C I don=E2=80=99t have any =E2=80=9Cexit plans=E2=80=
=9D because that=E2=80=99s not a viable sort of thing for a crucially impo=
rtant country of 325 million. If the proverbial shit hits the fan=2C nowhe=
re on this planet will be a good place to be.

I think all the off-the-grid and walled-city apocalyptic fever dreams serv=
e an important function in imagining the elements of the future=2C but the=
y are only useful so long as you take them =E2=80=9Cseriously but not lite=
rally.=E2=80=9D The moment you start taking them literally=2C your society=
 is screwed. Because the world is more complex and interesting than the li=
mited imagination of a 14-year old sci-fi nerd.

16. Top 5 things you learned in 2018? -- Nick

This is really not a mental model I use or even could use if I wanted to.=
 Learning is integral to life rather than a logbook of discrete rankable e=
ntries for me. All I can say is that my life and thinking got more or less=
 interesting compared to previous years. If there=E2=80=99s an increase=2C=
 it probably means I learned something. But it=E2=80=99s not something I c=
an quantify=2C let alone unbundle and rank.

17. Advice for 21 y.o. to break smart? I'm a generalist/dilettante; good a=
t holistic thinking/mental models=2C verbal skills=2C and writing; decent=
 at data science/coding (but have no interest in pursuing it). Considering=
 PhD in social science. How to succeed without being technical/programmer?=
 -- Adam

Solve for volume/high output. What can you do day in and day out=2C produc=
ing visible output=2C while staying interested and engaged? Avoid high-lev=
el abstract self-descriptors like =E2=80=9Cgeneralist=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=
=9Cdilettante.=E2=80=9D That=E2=80=99s a sign of sloppy introspection. Wou=
ld you say you are =E2=80=9Cgeneralist=E2=80=9D about brushing your teeth?=
 Use object-level=2C non-proxy ways of being aware of your output=2C wheth=
er it is words published=2C or pages of private notebooks filled=2C or con=
versations with people that =E2=80=9Cworked=E2=80=9D on some level.

There is always a volume unit. Find it. Then pump it up. Get it to a flow=

18. How would you as a hypothetical unskilled person create an internet bu=
siness with $10=2C000 of start up capital that could 1) scale=2C 2)persist=
=2C 3) generate >$300k in annual revenue within four years? No breaking la=
ws and nothing trendy allowed. -- Jeff Weiner

10k starting capital to 300k revenue in 4 years? Let=E2=80=99s estimate th=
e ROIC on that. Margins are related to the technology factor in the busine=
ss model=2C which is what expectations are based on. Higher margins =3D mo=
re technology in the economic =E2=80=9Cflywheel=E2=80=9D=2C which means yo=
u can assume a higher valuation multiple from the earnings. So for example=
=2C with 10% margins=2C I=E2=80=99d guess it is a pure service business. A=
t 1% I=E2=80=99d guess some high-volume commodity. A 60-70% GM is probably=
 a nice hardware business with a nice IP moat.

Let=E2=80=99s work through the implications of a 33% gross margin on 300k=
 revenue as an example. This probably means you=E2=80=99re doing some tech=
-enabled but human-powered service. Maybe you can assume a P/E of about 20=
=2C which means the business is worth ~2 million. So that really means you=
=E2=80=99re aiming for a 200x ROIC in 4 years! Obviously=2C very few reali=
stic businesses have that kind of return profile without a major innovatio=
n powering them=2C which means you either have a REALLY bright idea=2C or=
 you=E2=80=99re not counting some sort of hidden investment. Maybe the val=
ue of your labor? Maybe you take a loss for the first 3 years?

The point of an exercise like this is to get a sense of the financial shap=
e of the business model you=E2=80=99re imagining in more specific detail=
=2C and recalibrate expectations more realistically=2C and come up with a=
 plan to address investment gaps. Then you compare it to the shapes of sim=
ilar and dissimilar businesses at a balance sheet level. Does it look like=
 a grocery store? Does it look like a SaaS product? Does it look like an E=
tsy craft store? Does it look like a consulting business that runs on labo=
r rather than product?

Once you=E2=80=99ve done that -- and there=E2=80=99s no substitute for spr=
eadsheet wrangling here -- you=E2=80=99ll get a sense of the kinds of busi=
ness opportunity you could target with the capital and time you have avail=
able (and the hidden number you didn=E2=80=99t share: the assumptions abou=
t cost structure for those 4 years -- living in your parents basement or i=
n Bali imply different cost structures from renting an apartment in San Fr=
ancisco).

19. Do you talk the way you write? or attempt to?  in conversations=2C are=
 you more cognizant & intentional or flowing & reactive? -- Danny Le

I don=E2=80=99t write in just one way so that=E2=80=99s hard to answer. My=
 conversational style is close to some of my more rambling=2C discursive=
=2C free-association essays=2C but is in general way more flowing and reac=
tive. Having another person in a sparring loop makes a very big difference=
 to how you talk. In general=2C I prefer talking to people who are well-ma=
tched with me=2C neither too much smarter=2C nor too much dumber. This ten=
ds to lead to the greatest harmonic resonance and a pleasantly exciting fl=
ow.

20. While in museums=2C I've noticed a near-linear transition from orderly=
/perspicuous/sublime to disjointed/obfuscated/bleak works as a function of=
 era - say=2C from antiquity through the present. Should content creators=
 strive to counteract this trend? -- Reginald Raye

Time is a very powerful organizing variable=2C and in general=2C unless yo=
u have an equally powerful overriding organizing logic=2C it=E2=80=99s har=
d to beat. One way to beat a temporal logic is with an alternative tempora=
l logic. For example organize according to life stage (childhood to death)=
 in presenting cultural material rather than historic (childhood through t=
he ages).

But in general=2C I am wary of =E2=80=9Cshoulds=E2=80=9D for creators. Cre=
ators =E2=80=9Cshould=E2=80=9D do whatever proves to be a fertile thing to=
 do=2C that creates a generative=2C high-output organizing logic for the w=
ork. If messing with conventional curatorial sensibilities unleashes energ=
y=2C then by all means do so. If it results in self-important wankery for=
 its own sake=2C then avoid it.

21. Looking at society through the lens of thermodynamics=2C is it plausib=
le that old/complicated/large societies are more subject to entropic ruin=
=2C and hence political destabilization? If yes=2C can a society 'stop the=
 clock' on entropic ruin by harnessing an energy source like fusion that d=
ramatically changes energy availability? -- Reginald Raye

Yes. I recommend Joseph Tainter=E2=80=99s The Collapse of Complex Societie=
s on this question. There is a fairly rich literature on this. Jeremy Rifk=
in has a few books that explore this theme too. Vaclav Smil is another goo=
d source.

22. That Vinod Khosla interview that=E2=80=99s going around got me thinkin=
g=2C especially the line =E2=80=9Cyour biz becomes your team=2C not your p=
lan=E2=80=9D. I realized the employees I want are already entrepreneurs. D=
o you know of any examples where multiple young startups merged together?=
 Your opinion on this approach? -- Zack Kowalik

Interesting question. Setting aside talent acquisition cases=2C I can=E2=
=80=99t think of any genuinely powerful examples=2C only clumsy mergers th=
at didn=E2=80=99t work or regular big company acquisitions. I think this i=
s more likely to work at a slightly later stage=2C as part of consolidatio=
n/aggregation during a business cycle downturn when the weaker (but still=
 valuable) businesses are at risk of dying.

I=E2=80=99d approach this as a =E2=80=9Cdate/party before marrying=E2=80=
=9D problem=2C and simply network with aligned businesses and get into sup=
ply/contracting type relationships with them. Then if the logic withstands=
 the test of an operating partnership=2C you can consider mergers at the r=
ight time.

23. I am interested in your thoughts on Lambda School=2C or rather alterna=
tive higher education as a whole. I was tempted to join their program in l=
ieu of college which I currently attend. Do you think programs like these=
 are worthwhile? -- Demetri Macioce

It=E2=80=99s a fascinating model and I hope it succeeds. It=E2=80=99s too=
 early to tell. College is now an expensive luxury which you should probab=
ly only do today if you actually enjoy it=2C and if the debt burden=2C if=
 any=2C is low compared to the realistic earning potential (after adjustin=
g for parental support). I would pick based on what you actually enjoy stu=
dying and working hard at. Lambda school is a great deal if you find you e=
njoy programming=2C but obviously not if you find you hate programming. Bu=
t if money is not an object and you get into Stanford=2C I=E2=80=99d still=
 recommend Stanford. There is no one-size-fits-all answer here. There are=
 good and bad reasons to make any of the available choices.

24. I=E2=80=99m a 22 year Army veteran=E2=80=A65 deployments. Are we stayi=
ng in Afghanistan primarily because of the sunk cost fallacy? -- Anonymous

I don=E2=80=99t think so. It=E2=80=99s more the exit cost reality than the=
 sunk cost fallacy. At this point I don=E2=80=99t think there is any good=
 reason to be there besides it being hard to disentangle from a messy situ=
ation in a strategically important place without causing all sorts of seco=
nd and third order ugly effects. It=E2=80=99s called the graveyard of empi=
res for a good reason. The Persian=2C British=2C and Soviet empires all su=
ffered from getting mired in the region. The US empire too is paying for a=
n ill-conceived presence in the region=2C and I=E2=80=99m sorry people lik=
e you have been roped into that ugly equation. I wish I had something smar=
ter to say=2C but I=E2=80=99m 44=2C and Afghanistan has been an unsolved p=
roblem for all my life. I don=E2=80=99t expect a clever solution to emerge=
 anytime soon. I suppose the US will eventually decide the exit cost is wo=
rth paying=2C withdraw=2C and we=E2=80=99ll all deal with the consequences=
 (especially the neighboring countries: Pakistan=2C Iran=2C India=2C the C=
entral Asian countries=2C and China).

25. What to do when you have a financially valuable skill but you=E2=80=99=
re tired of using it? -- Jen Adams

Save enough money=2C learn another skill=2C and get out. If you can=E2=80=
=99t=2C well=2C we all gotta do what we gotta do to keep going. The simple=
st questions are always the most impossible to answer cleverly.

26. Money=2C more and more=2C seems to me a tool of oppression=2C and I've=
 been struggling with the implications of this. How can I / do you / shoul=
d one justify its making and spending when each dollar comes to be perceiv=
ed as a unit of violence? -- Carson Pepin.

I think this is poetic nonsense. It=E2=80=99s just another technology that=
 works as a double-edged sword. People oppress people=2C and employ whatev=
er tools are available to do so. Some technologies are certainly more viol=
ent than others=2C like guns and bombs=2C but money isn=E2=80=99t one of t=
hem. It=E2=80=99s too general-purpose. Anything (or any set of things) tha=
t replaces money as the technology of economic organization will have exac=
tly as much potential for oppressive violence.

If anything=2C historically speaking=2C money has been a great tool of low=
ering oppression and violence. It allows trade to replace wars=2C and fost=
ers economic community in place of tribal antagonism. Sure it has its viol=
ent externalities=2C especially on the environment=2C but I=E2=80=99m defi=
nitely a partisan for Team Money. I think playing the game of making money=
 and using it wisely for yourself and others is a good game for our specie=
s to be playing. Certainly better than going at each other with guns and s=
words.

27. I'm a VC associate planning to start a company=2C but still looking fo=
r the big idea. What's the best way to come up with both consumer or enter=
prise startup ideas? -- Anonymous

The upside of coming from the investment side of the game rather than the=
 ideas and rent-and-ramen side is that you are probably way more dispassio=
nate and grounded than stereotypical entrepreneurs are. The downside is th=
at you might suffer an imagination or passion deficit in whatever you do.=
 The fact that you haven=E2=80=99t even picked consumer versus enterprise=
 (very different psychological profiles) suggests you=E2=80=99re naturally=
 more of a customer-driven wonk rather than a product-driven maven. If you=
 make mistakes -- and of course you will -- it will likely be of the =E2=
=80=9Cugly thing trying to please everybody=E2=80=9D variety rather than t=
he Juicero variety.

Exploit the strength: the =E2=80=9Cbest way=E2=80=9D for you to come up wi=
th an idea is to grind away at a spreadsheet full of data and analytical i=
nsights until you spot a hole or whitespace with the right profile. The Je=
ff Bezos way rather than the Steve Jobs way of =E2=80=9Cstudy fonts and de=
sign and go on a spiritual journey=E2=80=9D way. It=E2=80=99s not the best=
 way for everybody=2C but it=E2=80=99s probably the best way for you. Then=
 you can go look for the right kinds of partners who can make up for any i=
magination/passion deficit.

28. Do you believe that language drives consciousness? If yes=2C do you th=
ink that as language evolves we=E2=80=99ll enter an advanced stage of cons=
ciousness? -- Patrick South

No and no. The first no is because we have existence proof of species that=
 appear to have subjective consciousness but lack language. The second no=
 because I think to the extent it was a consciousness driver=2C it was a o=
ne-shot deal (with chapters for oral and written). Future evolutionary lea=
ps in consciousness will come from other sources.

29. My romanticist heart lies with voice over exit=2C but the defining (be=
st?) decisions of my career were exits. At my current job=2C I'm learning=
 voice can't change some critical things=2C even with credibility/goodwill=
=2E I have an opportunity to exit=2C and maybe even be someone in the proces=
s. Do I? -- Anonymous

Yes. Life is too short to persist with voice for too long once you run out=
 of a reasonable expectation of positive change. If you can leave for bett=
er things=2C do so. Try to leave on good terms=2C but if you must burn bri=
dges=2C do so.

30. Emerging markets have lots of good people and lots of smartphones but=
 few trusted institutions=2C resulting in low trust and limited commerce.=
 What are the biggest barriers to using working and learning data generate=
d by people in the workplace to getting companies access to global capital=
 markets? -- Jay Larson

Setting aside formal governmental barriers=2C I think capital at a distanc=
e is by definition dumb capital. Most VC investments still happen within a=
 just a few dozen miles of the VC firm for example. So for emerging market=
s=2C the capital -- and the capitalists who participate in it -- must go t=
o the market to make their money smart enough to play locally. The market=
=2C beyond a point=2C cannot come to the capital. Capital has a kind of mo=
bility people=2C markets=2C technology=2C and even data do not. Data out o=
f context gets dumb really fast. I=E2=80=99m not fetishizing some sort of=
 =E2=80=9Csmall local banks=E2=80=9D philosophy of investment. Just pointi=
ng out an impedance mismatch between money smarts and market smarts create=
d by investment distance.

I think there is far less capital mobility than there should be because=2C=
 frankly=2C investors are by definition rich people who don=E2=80=99t like=
 to go to places that are not that comfortable and fun in order to invest=
 well. So the smart ones stick to investments they can do smartly from the=
 comfort of their first world lives. The dumb ones try to invest too far a=
way and fail.

Think about things like microcredit honestly to understand the anthropolog=
y of the capital-distance equation properly.

31. What should I learn and which money game should I play if I want to:
- continually explore new experiences/skills/ideas (vs "be productive" or=
 "seek epaulettes")
- spend time with people I genuinely like
- have $100k/yr (or more) to spend on life

-- Andrew Swearengen

Well=2C you don't want much=2C do you? That isn't really a question so muc=
h as a rather lazy bounding box for life itself. You're going to have to a=
sk more imaginative questions (not just of me=2C but of life itself) if yo=
u want good answers. Based on your bounding box=2C all you can do is do so=
me not-very-useful eliminations like "don't join the military" or "don't g=
o live in the developing world." And worse=2C because the bounding box is=
 so "commodity"=2C you're likely to make serious errors with the obvious e=
liminations.

So my meta-answer is: learn to ask better questions :)

32. How do you get out of Big Data Analyst/Consultant hell and into a posi=
tion of actual Ownership/Authority w/in some company? Feel like my Analyst=
 and Business Chops are better than most people w/in a Big Company + Execu=
tive Level thinking snd yet stuck at Analyst grunt work positions. -- Anon=
ymous

When you are identified with the agency embodied by a tool=2C it is hard t=
o break out. So long as you think of yourself in terms of your tool-based=
 process skills=2C you'll never break out of middle management at best=2C=
 unless somebody makes a mistake in promoting you. Your mistake is thinkin=
g of your superior skill with your tools as an asset rather than a liabili=
ty. Those executives are above you because they're worse than you at speci=
fic skills=2C not despite being worse.

Good individual contributors have identities tied to hands-on skills. Good=
 middle managers have identities tied to important process skills. Good ex=
ecutives have identities tied to risk-taking skills. Good owners have iden=
tities tied to capital deployment skills (which largely consists of knowin=
g when to say yes and no to opportunities).

One suggestion I can make is: position yourself around people who are even=
 better than you are at your Big Data/Analyst skills. That will create a f=
orcing function in your life. You'll either make yourself useful at a high=
er level of the game=2C or you'll crash and burn. If that sounds too risky=
/difficult=2C then you might not be as suited for executive work as you th=
ink.

33. Most underrated city in/of the next 20 years -- Otis Funkmeyer

Congrats=2C you've stumped me. I honestly have no idea. Most of the big ci=
ties are overrated=2C but I don't know how to systematically look for unde=
rrated in a general sense. I'd like to move to one. Seattle is somewhat un=
derrated=2C but I wouldn't call it the most underrated.

 my AMA prompt last week. Only a couple of TMS -- tell me something --&nbs=
p; responses though. So that part of the experiment didn't quite work.<br>
<br>
Almost all the questions were kinda interesting and fun to think about=2C=
 so I'm going to post my responses to almost of them. It's too much for on=
e newsletter=2C so I'm going to break it down into two issues. Here's the=
 first set of responses=2C to the first 33 questions=2C taken in order. I'=
ll do the rest next week. In some cases=2C I've anonymized the question ev=
en though the questioner didn't ask for it=2C since the details seemed per=
sonal.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The questions span the gamut from industry trends and personal career ques=
tions to Big History questions and questions about consciousness. What I l=
earned about myself is that I am sort of the Walmart of quick premium-medi=
ocre baseline takes on almost any subject. I don't have to think for more=
 than a few seconds to come up with an off-the-top-of-my-head not-too-terr=
ible answer to most questions. Only one person managed to entirely stump m=
e in this set.<br>
<br>
Well hear we go. Good Afternoon=2C Internet=2C I'm Talking.

<em>12. Good coworkers (decent human beings)=2C decent money=2C good poten=

 What should one do? -- Anonymous</em><br>
<br>
This is a hard problem. I see motivation as synonymous with high-volume ou=
tput. Whatever your mode of =E2=80=9Cwork=2C=E2=80=9D you are motivated if=
 and only if you=E2=80=99re producing high-volume output driven by a tight=
 positive feedback loop keeping you in flow state=2C which is by nature un=
stable. Two ways it breaks is if the feedback loop doesn=E2=80=99t fuel yo=
ur imagination (insufficient novelty in the OODA loop) or it doesn=E2=80=
=99t fuel your risk appetite (insufficient stakes in the OODA loop).<br>
<br>
If it is risk=2C you can financially engineer a risk differential between=
 you and your coworkers (example=2C take on personal debt for a bigger equ=
ity position and use that to go after riskier business where you=E2=80=99l=
l suffer the downside and upside more). If it is imagination=2C it is much=
 harder: you have to siphon off a portion of working cash flow to fund mor=
e interesting activities=2C but you will need to find collaborators with t=
he an impedance matched imagination.<br>

<br>
I=E2=80=99ve gone back and forth on these. Sometimes they are practically=
 necessary because of the context. You don=E2=80=99t get to Mars without a=
 long-term plan of sorts. If there are no practical constraints dictating=

 I don=E2=80=99t think bloggers should plan more than a few posts out at m=
ost. It=E2=80=99s a recipe for failure. If you want to go longer range=2C=
 write a book (ie pick a project structure that has the time constants you=
 are attracted to).<br>
<br>
Beyond these? I think it comes down to temperament really. Everybody has a=
 natural time constant=2C and constraints tying them to domains with domai=

king laws and nothing trendy allowed. -- Jeff Weiner</em><br>
<br>
10k starting capital to 300k revenue in 4 years? Let=E2=80=99s estimate th=

ss model=2C which is what expectations are based on. Higher margins =3D mo=
re technology in the economic =E2=80=9Cflywheel=E2=80=9D=2C which means yo=
u can assume a higher valuation multiple from the earnings. So for example=
=2C with 10% margins=2C I=E2=80=99d guess it is a pure service business. A=
t 1% I=E2=80=99d guess some high-volume commodity. A 60-70% GM is probably=
 a nice hardware business with a nice IP moat.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Let=E2=80=99s work through the implications of a 33% gross margin on 300k=
 revenue as an example. This probably means you=E2=80=99re doing some tech=
-enabled but human-powered service. Maybe you can assume a P/E of about 20=
=2C which means the business is worth ~2 million. So that really means you=
=E2=80=99re aiming for a 200x ROIC in 4 years! Obviously=2C very few reali=

n powering them=2C which means you either have a REALLY bright idea=2C or=
 you=E2=80=99re not counting some sort of hidden investment. Maybe the val=
ue of your labor? Maybe you take a loss for the first 3 years?<br>
<br>
The point of an exercise like this is to get a sense of the financial shap=
e of the business model you=E2=80=99re imagining in more specific detail=
=2C and recalibrate expectations more realistically=2C and come up with a=
 plan to address investment gaps. Then you compare it to the shapes of sim=

 a grocery store? Does it look like a SaaS product? Does it look like an E=

<br>
Once you=E2=80=99ve done that -- and there=E2=80=99s no substitute for spr=
eadsheet wrangling here -- you=E2=80=99ll get a sense of the kinds of busi=
ness opportunity you could target with the capital and time you have avail=
able (and the hidden number you didn=E2=80=99t share: the assumptions abou=

<br>
Time is a very powerful organizing variable=2C and in general=2C unless yo=

I think this is poetic nonsense. It=E2=80=99s just another technology that=

<br>
If anything=2C historically speaking=2C money has been a great tool of low=

<br>
The upside of coming from the investment side of the game rather than the=
 ideas and rent-and-ramen side is that you are probably way more dispassio=
nate and grounded than stereotypical entrepreneurs are. The downside is th=
at you might suffer an imagination or passion deficit in whatever you do.=
 The fact that you haven=E2=80=99t even picked consumer versus enterprise=
 (very different psychological profiles) suggests you=E2=80=99re naturally=
 more of a customer-driven wonk rather than a product-driven maven. If you=
 make mistakes -- and of course you will -- it will likely be of the =E2=
=80=9Cugly thing trying to please everybody=E2=80=9D variety rather than t=
he Juicero variety.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Exploit the strength: the =E2=80=9Cbest way=E2=80=9D for you to come up wi=
th an idea is to grind away at a spreadsheet full of data and analytical i=
nsights until you spot a hole or whitespace with the right profile. The Je=
ff Bezos way rather than the Steve Jobs way of =E2=80=9Cstudy fonts and de=
sign and go on a spiritual journey=E2=80=9D way. It=E2=80=99s not the best=

<br>
Setting aside formal governmental barriers=2C I think capital at a distanc=
e is by definition dumb capital. Most VC investments still happen within a=
 just a few dozen miles of the VC firm for example. So for emerging market=
s=2C the capital -- and the capitalists who participate in it -- must go t=
o the market to make their money smart enough to play locally. The market=
=2C beyond a point=2C cannot come to the capital. Capital has a kind of mo=

f context gets dumb really fast. I=E2=80=99m not fetishizing some sort of=
 =E2=80=9Csmall local banks=E2=80=9D philosophy of investment. Just pointi=
ng out an impedance mismatch between money smarts and market smarts create=
d by investment distance.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I think there is far less capital mobility than there should be because=2C=
 frankly=2C investors are by definition rich people who don=E2=80=99t like=
 to go to places that are not that comfortable and fun in order to invest=
 well. So the smart ones stick to investments they can do smartly from the=
 comfort of their first world lives. The dumb ones try to invest too far a=
way and fail.<br>
