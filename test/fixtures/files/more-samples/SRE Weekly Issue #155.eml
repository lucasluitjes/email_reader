The Conclusion section sums it up nicely:

In this post=2C we talked about various delivery guarantee semantics such=
 as at-least-once=2C at-most-once=2C and exactly-once. We also talked abou=
t why exactly-once is important=2C the issues in the way of achieving exac=

ration and minimal coding.

Designing resilient systems: Circuit Breakers or Retries? (Part 2) (https:=
//engineering.grab.com/designing-resilient-systems-part-2)

This post is the second part of the series on Designing Resilient Systems.=
 In Part 1=2C we looked at use cases for implementing circuit breakers. In=
 this second part=2C we will do a deep dive on retries and its use cases=
=2C followed by a technical comparison of both approaches.

This article is really thorough and includes a section on combining retrie=
s with circuit breakers.

Towards Successful Resilient Software Design (https://www.infoq.com/articl=
es/towards-resilient-software-design)

The problem is that most advice how to =E2=80=9Cget design right=E2=80=9D=
 only applies to design inside a process boundary. Most of those advices d=
o not work well if applied to distributed systems.

What I have learnt over time is that we basically need to re-learn how to=
 design systems=2C i.e.=2C how to spread the functionality in a distribute=
d environment.
