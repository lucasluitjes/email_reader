Sarah Mei on Twitter: compensation for on-call (https://twitter.com/sarahm=
ei/status/1078475018294616065)

My fundamental issue with being on call is that I care more about my perso=
nal life & health than I do about whether my employer=E2=80=99s website is=
 operational.

I assume everyone does! So=E2=80=A6why do we put up with on-call at all?

Required reading for anyone who=E2=80=99s on call or manages folks that ar=
e on call.
